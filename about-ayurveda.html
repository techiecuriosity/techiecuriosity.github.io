        <h1>About Ayurveda</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Ayurveda is an ancient Indian system of medicine and wellness that has been practiced for thousands of years. The word "Ayurveda" comes from the Sanskrit words "ayur" (life) and "veda" (knowledge), meaning "the knowledge of life."</p>
            
            <h2>The Three Doshas</h2>
            <p>At the core of Ayurveda are the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. These are the fundamental energies that govern our physical and mental processes:</p>
            
            <div class="dosha-info">
                <h3>Vata (Air + Space)</h3>
                <p>Vata governs movement, creativity, and communication. When in balance, it promotes flexibility and enthusiasm. When out of balance, it can cause anxiety and restlessness.</p>
                
                <h3>Pitta (Fire + Water)</h3>
                <p>Pitta governs digestion, metabolism, and transformation. When in balance, it promotes intelligence and understanding. When out of balance, it can cause anger and inflammation.</p>
                
                <h3>Kapha (Earth + Water)</h3>
                <p>Kapha governs structure, stability, and lubrication. When in balance, it promotes strength and endurance. When out of balance, it can cause lethargy and attachment.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>The Five Elements</h2>
            <p>Ayurveda is based on the concept of five elements that make up the universe and our bodies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Space (Akasha)</li>
                <li>Air (Vayu)</li>
                <li>Fire (Agni)</li>
                <li>Water (Jala)</li>
                <li>Earth (Prithvi)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Balance and Health</h2>
            <p>According to Ayurveda, health is achieved when the doshas are in balance, digestion is strong, tissues are healthy, and waste is properly eliminated. Imbalance in any of these areas can lead to disease.</p>
            
            <h2>Modern Applications</h2>
            <p>Today, Ayurveda is practiced worldwide and has influenced many modern wellness practices. It offers a holistic approach to health that considers diet, lifestyle, environment, and mental well-being.</p>
